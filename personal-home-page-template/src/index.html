            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Lungelo Tom and I am 21 years old. I reside in Khayelitsha township which is situated in Cape Town. I am a recent graduate at the University of the Western Cape in Bellville with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I started programming in 2016 when I was in 10th grade using Delphi. We also had a robotics class where we used NXT and lego componets to complete practiclas. From those moments became more interested in the tech field and my information technology teacher showed us all the amazing jobs in the tech field.
               <br>   
               One of my personal traits is that I never give up, even when I fail I get upchange my startegy and try again. <br>Here is a video that gets me out of bed every day:
